# Remaking Cave Story in C++

This repository contains my attempt to work through [Limeoats](https://github.com/limeoats)'s tutorial series for [Remaking Cavestory in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETvApbD5xRo&list=PLNOBk_id22bw6LXhrGfhVwqQIa-M2MsLa) as in exercise in learning and building with C++

## Building

* Install `libsdl2-dev` (?) for your distribution.
* Install `libsdl2-image-dev`
* Run `make run`

Visual Studio Code should be somewhat set up for debugging.
